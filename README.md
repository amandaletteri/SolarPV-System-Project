# SolarPV-System-Project
After 7 months of learning data science skills, including but not limited to Python, R
SQL, NoSQL, and multiple continuous and categorical data analysis, this is the
final project for our studies. 
My partner @amandaletteri and I selected datasets that were created by surveys taken from Adopters 
and Considerers of Solar (Photovoltaic) Panels from 4 different states: New Jersey, New York, Arizona, and California.
We decided to do our final project on only Adopters and data coming only from those in California.
